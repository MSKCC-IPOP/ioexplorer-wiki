Start with the [Selection Dogma](documentation/selection-dogma.md) to understand how data is arranged in the system.

Review the [Subject to Sample Mapping](documentation/subject-to-sample-mapping.md) policies and see how they affect your analyses.

Learn about the [Advanced Filter Language](documentation/advanced-filter-language.md) and how to use it to refine your sample selection.

Read about [Custom Comparison Groups](documentation/custom-comparison-groups.md) and how to define them for advanced endpoint analysis.
